## Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard offers visualizations and data-driven insights into key HR metrics such as employee turnover, diversity, performance, and recruitment. By leveraging Tableau, the dashboard allows HR teams to monitor trends, identify risks, and optimize workforce planning.

In this project, we explore a dataset for Atlas Labs to understand the factors influencing employee attrition. By leveraging Tableau, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create a clean, self-explanatory, and interactive dashboard tailored for the HR team.

The ultimate goal of this project is to empower Atlas Labs with data-driven insights to address employee turnover and enhance retention strategies.

## Objectives
#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Dive deep into workforce data to identify patterns and trends.
* Focus on variables that significantly impact attrition.

#### 2. Dashboard Creation:
* Build an interactive dashboard in Tableau for HR professionals.
* Ensure it is clean, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.

#### 3. Actionable Insights:
* Provide recommendations to the HR team based on analysis.
* Highlight areas where intervention is required to reduce attrition

#### 4. Dashboard Screenshoot

#### 5. Summary
The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of HR analytics for Atlas Labs, highlighting key metrics and trends. The average age of employees is 29, with 1,233 active employees out of a total of 1,470. The attrition rate stands at 16.1%, with 237 employees having left the company. Attrition is highest in the Sales department, particularly among Sales Representatives (39.8%) and Human Resources Recruiters (37.5%). Technology roles like Data Scientist (23.8%) and Software Engineer (16.0%) also show notable attrition rates. Employees aged 20–29 experience the highest attrition, indicating potential challenges in retaining younger talent. Job satisfaction varies across roles, with Data Scientists and Software Engineers reporting higher satisfaction levels, while HR and managerial roles show more dissatisfaction or neutrality. Education-wise, employees with Marketing (65) and Computer Science (59) degrees exhibit higher turnover, while Business Studies and Information Systems have lower counts. Gender and age analyses reveal that males have slightly higher attrition rates in most age groups, though females show significant proportions in the 20–29 and over 50 categories. Non-binary and "Prefer Not to Say" groups also contribute, though at smaller levels.

#### 6. Recommendations
* Focus on Retaining Younger Talent: Since employees aged 20–29 have the highest attrition rate, consider implementing mentorship programs, career development plans, and competitive benefits to retain this age group.
* Address High Turnover in Sales Roles: With Sales Representatives showing the highest attrition, review workload, compensation structures, and career advancement opportunities to enhance job satisfaction and retention in this area.
* Enhance Engagement in HR and Technology Roles: HR Recruiters and technology-related positions (e.g., Data Scientists) also exhibit high turnover. Conduct regular feedback sessions and create targeted retention strategies such as skill development programs and better work-life balance initiatives.
* Reassess Job Satisfaction: For roles with neutral or dissatisfied responses in the job satisfaction heatmap, like HR Executives and Managers, develop action plans such as increasing managerial support, recognition programs, or stress management resources.
* Tailored Retention Programs by Education: Employees with Marketing and Computer Science degrees exhibit high turnover. Provide opportunities for upskilling, certification programs, or career-path counseling specific to these groups to encourage loyalty.
* Monitor Gender Diversity and Inclusivity: Although attrition rates are slightly higher among males, the HR team should also focus on inclusivity for non-binary and other underrepresented groups by ensuring equal opportunities, fostering a supportive culture, and addressing any potential biases.
