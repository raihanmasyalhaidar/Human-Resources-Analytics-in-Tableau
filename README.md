## Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard offers visualizations and data-driven insights into key HR metrics such as employee turnover, diversity, performance, and recruitment. By leveraging Tableau, the dashboard allows HR teams to monitor trends, identify risks, and optimize workforce planning.

In this project, we explore a dataset for Atlas Labs to understand the factors influencing employee attrition. By leveraging Tableau, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create a clean, self-explanatory, and interactive dashboard tailored for the HR team.

The ultimate goal of this project is to empower Atlas Labs with data-driven insights to address employee turnover and enhance retention strategies.

## Objectives
#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Dive deep into workforce data to identify patterns and trends.
* Focus on variables that significantly impact attrition.

#### 2. Dashboard Creation:
* Build an interactive dashboard in Tableau for HR professionals.
* Ensure it is clean, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.

#### 3. Actionable Insights:
* Provide recommendations to the HR team based on analysis.
* Highlight areas where intervention is required to reduce attrition

#### 4. Dashboard Screenshoot

#### 5. Summary
The HR Analytics dashboards provide comprehensive insights into workforce demographics, attrition trends, and overall employee engagement. The first dashboard offers an overview of key metrics, including average age, active employees, attrition count, and attrition rate, highlighting critical areas such as high attrition rates in departments like Technology and Sales. Visualizations, such as bubble charts, depict department-wise attrition, while bar and line charts emphasize younger employees (20–29) as the most affected age group. A heatmap of job satisfaction scores indicates dissatisfaction in certain roles, strongly correlating with higher turnover rates.

The second dashboard dives deeper into employee demographics, showcasing the age distribution, where most employees fall within the 20–29 range. It also visualizes salary disparities across ethnic groups, offering insights into potential equity issues. Additionally, gender-specific attrition analysis reveals higher turnover rates among younger females, while marital status distribution suggests that single employees might be more prone to attrition. These insights are complemented by a combination of bar and line charts highlighting differences in average salaries and tenure across diverse demographic groups.

The third dashboard focuses on attrition analysis, identifying specific factors contributing to employee turnover. For instance, employees with frequent travel show lower attrition rates than non-travelers, while overtime requirements are directly linked to higher turnover. Tenure analysis highlights a critical retention challenge among employees with less than three years of service. Moreover, trends in attrition rates over the years provide insights into how external or internal factors may have influenced workforce stability.

#### 6. Recommendations
Based on these dashboards, several recommendations emerge. Organizations should focus on reducing attrition in high-turnover departments by enhancing job satisfaction through career development opportunities and better work-life balance initiatives. Addressing salary disparities and promoting equity across ethnic groups can foster inclusivity and engagement. Reducing overtime and monitoring its impact on employee burnout are crucial to retention strategies. Additionally, tailored onboarding programs and mentorship initiatives for employees with less than three years of tenure can improve long-term retention. By leveraging these data-driven insights, organizations can optimize their HR strategies, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover effectively.
