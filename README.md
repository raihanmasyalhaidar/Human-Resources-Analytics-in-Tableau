## Overview
The HR Analytics Dashboard offers visualizations and data-driven insights into key HR metrics such as employee turnover, diversity, performance, and recruitment. By leveraging Tableau, the dashboard allows HR teams to monitor trends, identify risks, and optimize workforce planning.

In this project, we explore a dataset for Atlas Labs to understand the factors influencing employee attrition. By leveraging Tableau, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and create a clean, self-explanatory, and interactive dashboard tailored for the HR team.

The ultimate goal of this project is to empower Atlas Labs with data-driven insights to address employee turnover and enhance retention strategies.

## Objectives
#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Dive deep into workforce data to identify patterns and trends.
* Focus on variables that significantly impact attrition.

#### 2. Dashboard Creation:
* Build an interactive dashboard in Tableau for HR professionals.
* Ensure it is clean, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.

#### 3. Actionable Insights:
* Provide recommendations to the HR team based on analysis.
* Highlight areas where intervention is required to reduce attrition
